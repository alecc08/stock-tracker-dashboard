This is a dashboard meant to integrate with my stock-tracker API: https://github.com/alecc08/stock-tracker

## What is this for?
This is a fun little project I'm working on to track certain stocks that I may be holding and keep track of profit and losses. The main purpose is to practice using certain technologies such as NodeJS and Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
